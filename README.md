write-up later

this composition is an impertinent shot at collaborative work with only one person involved being aware of any collaboration.

i've done this before so i know what i'm talking about.

the initial code was writen by [ge1doot](http://codepen.io/ge1doot/) in his awesome composition [recorded conversations](http://codepen.io/ge1doot/pen/pvXYMG).

from there it was forked several times by [rafszul](http://codepen.io/rafszul/) and molested mercilessly for few days and nights.

then came the awesome [Edgy Ziane](https://www.facebook.com/EdgyZiane/timeline) with his graphical talents matching the programing skills of [ge1doot](http://codepen.io/ge1doot/) and practice of digital voodoo of [rafszul](http://codepen.io/rafszul/).

all that was needed to make it into an awesome digital enchantment was drumms and music to match the three previously mentioned talents. and where to find something 


 up until



there are credits to do but the comp is pretty clear on that

maybe change of font
